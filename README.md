Hey there, I'm Rubi, and I love building websites and apps that make a positive difference in people's lives. I'm skilled in using JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS/Sass, React.js, and Express.js. I also know my way around managing databases with MySQL and Sequelize. I'm a team player, pay close attention to details, and I'm always learning to improve my software engineering skills. Let's create something awesome together!
